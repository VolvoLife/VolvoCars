	<p class = "border" >The Volvo 200 Series also known as the "240 and 260 Series" is a model of sedan and estate cars produced by Volvo from 1974 until 1993, which outlasted its intended predacessor the Volvo 740.It sold more than 2.8 million worldwide. Like the Volvo 140 Series (1966 to 1974), from which it was developed, it was designed by Jan Wilsgaard Volvos top designer. The series overlapped production of the Volvo 700 Series which was suppose to replace the 240 but the 240 outlived the 700 series. The 700 was replaced by the 900 Series in 1992, a year before the 240 was discontinued in 1993. Production of the 240 ended on 14 May 1993, after nearly 20 years on the market.</p>
