	<p class = "border" >The Volvo XC90 is a luxury SUV manufactured and marketed by Volvo since 2002 and now in its second generation model. The first generation was introduced at the 2002 North American International Auto Show. Volvo moved production equipment of the first generation to China when the company was aquired by Geeley and ended Swedish production at the end of 2014, renaming the car as the Volvo XC90 Classic. At the end of 2014, the second generation XC90 was introduced. Both generations of the XC90 have won Motor Trend's SUV of the Year award in their debuts. In late 2022, the electric-only EX90 was introduced as the successor of the XC90.</p>
